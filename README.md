# Hugo Gallery Tools

Some tools to manage hugo gallery.

## generate_pages.py

This python script will generate the `_index.md` file inside `content/` directory.

Run it from the photos directory in `static/` and it'll create all the necessary in `content/`. 

You can create sub album tree by copying the `_index.md` file into the parents directories and removing the `resources` block from it.
